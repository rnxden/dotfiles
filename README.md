    Configuration files for personalizing my Linux environment
  </b>
</p>

This repo contains my dotfiles, a set of configuration files for customizing the different programs I use on my Linux
machine. Since I use Linux both through the terminal and through a graphical interface, there will be configs for both
CLI/TUI and GUI programs.

Although the config files themselves should work for any Linux distro, my distro of choice is Arch (btw), so the
bootstrapper scripts that come with this repo are designed specifically to work on Arch Linux, and are not guaranteed to
work on any other distro.
